# Sonar

Sonar is an HTML5-only network diagnostic tool that utilizes the [perfSonar](http://www.perfsonar.net/) as well as NDT javascript libraries developed by [M-Lab](http://www.measurementlab.net/).

### Java

As Java plugins / applets are being deprecated as a technology by most major browsers, Sonar relies strictly on Javascript and HTML5 (Websockets and Workers).

## Installation

Simple copy the contents into a web readable directory and [customize](#customization) to suit. No use of server-side scripting languages (PHP, etc) is required.

## Customization

Several customization options are available that can be suited to your environment. Titles, text and logos can be edited directly through the index.html file or the /sonar/app/config.js file.

## Documentation

Full developer-level documentation can be found in the [documentation/Sonar](documentation/sonar) directory.
